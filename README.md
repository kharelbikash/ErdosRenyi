# ErdosRenyi
ErdosRenyi generate a random undirected graph G ac-
cording to the famous Erdos-Renyi model. Erdos-Renyi graphs is an impor-
tant tool in social network analysis. They represent a baseline against which
social network graphs are compared in order to identify their characteristic
features.
This program will take two command line arguments N and p where N > 0
is the number of nodes in the graph, and 0 < p <= 1 is the probability
that an arbitrary pair of nodes is connected by an edge.
